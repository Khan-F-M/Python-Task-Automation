This will involve some basic web scraping with the pandas library. This consists in extracting data
from websites by using some automated teqniqes.

Firstly we're going to find a cvs file containing a certain data set. In our case we will use the website:
https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

Now, keep in mind you have to give it the correct location address of the file, however for our sake
we will use the link address directly from the site instead.

The rest is practically the same as the last extraction. However this time we didnt get an array of tables. We got a single table. So doing array[1] won't work. 

Also to rename columns, you use a rename method that accepts key:value pairs, key being the column name currently,
and value being the new column name. 

Example:

df_premier.rename(columns={'FTHG':'goals','FTAG':'goals_wide'}, inplace=True)
