**MAKE SURE THE LINE NUMBERS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE ARE IN ORDER OTHERWISE CODE DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY***
**IT'S PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS NOTEBOOK UI WORKS**

we will extract the tables from wikipedia using the pandas library.

First to install the pandas library, open a notebook terminal and type "pip install pandas".

Once that is installed, import the pandas as pd(short form) 

Then write:

naruto = pd.read_html('')

In the brackets, you will put the link of website. In our case it would be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_(season_1)\

To know how many tables are stored in naruto (array), type len(naruto).
This would give you the number of tables. Then proceed to print any of them.

For example:

naruto[1]
