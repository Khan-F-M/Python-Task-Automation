/ - selects the children from the node set on the left side
// - specifies that the matching node set should be located at any level
    --example: //body/p
        > this gives you the all the p elements in body

    --example: //body//text()
        > this grabs all the text in the body element

    -- in regards to //, this can be used to find a specific
        structure of elements at any level. a single / would
        only go the the children, but a // looks for this element
        structure on the whole page.

. - specifies that the current
.. - specifies the parent
    --example: //p/..
        > this would select the parent of body, in this case <body>

* - wildcard character/selects all
    --example: //*
        > this gives every single element on the page.

The code I am working with:
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Welcome to my <a href="#">page</a></h2>
        <p class='first'>This is the first paragraph</p>.
        <p class='second'>This is the second paragraph</p>.
        <!-- this is the end -->
    </body>
</html>
