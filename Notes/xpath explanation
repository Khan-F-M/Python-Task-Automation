playground to test XPath: https://scrapinghub.github.io/xpath-playground/

XPath syntax:
    //tagName - selects the all the tag name elements
        -- example is like //h1. This would select all the
            h1 in the document/webpage.

        -- You could also select one by using indices.
            so it would look like //h1[1]. (1 is for the first one,
            there is no 0 index in this)

        -- you can also specify the attribute of the element. it would
            look like //h1[@class='plot']

    starts-with() - search's for text at the beginning
    contains() - search's for text included inside the element.
        -- example would be like //p[contains(@class, 'first')]

    and - //tagName[(expression 1) and (expression 2)]
    or - //tagName[(expression 1) or (expression 2)]
        --example: //p[(@class='first') or (@class='second')]
