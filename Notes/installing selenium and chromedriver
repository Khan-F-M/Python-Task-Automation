INSTALLING CHROMEDRIVER

1. Find what version of chrome you're using by going
    clicking on the three dots on the top right, going
    to 'Help', then clicking on 'About Google Chrome'.

2. To download the chrome driver, go to: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
    and click the version that fits your chrome version

3. After clicking, you'll be given a linux type directory, pick the
    OS that fits your computer (Windows for me). This will start the
    zip download

4. After downloading the file, put it into a drive/folder that you'll
    remember and unzip it. The path will be used later.


INSTALLING SELENIUM

1. This is a much simpler process. It will be installed through
    a terminal. So open a terminal, or virtual environment in pyCharm.

2. Type the command 'pip install selenium'
